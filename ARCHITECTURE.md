# ARCHITECTURE — how jivo-factory-intel is built

How the data physically flows and where everything lives. Read **[`README.md`](README.md)** first for
the mental model; read **[`VAULT-GUIDE.md`](VAULT-GUIDE.md)** next for how to read the output, and
**[`REFRESH-RUNBOOK.md`](REFRESH-RUNBOOK.md)** for the operational commands.

---

## The core idea

> The `ji.jivo.in` factory app describes Jivo Mart's physical operation — every gate arrival, vehicle,
> barcode carton, scan, dispatch, inspection, SAP item — as records behind a REST API. This repo
> captures **every record losslessly** and renders **one Obsidian note per record**, with every
> foreign key emitted as a `[[wikilink]]` so the whole operation becomes a navigable graph. It does so
> **deterministically and with no LLM**: each refresh is a complete **full-replace mirror** — the
> renderer wipes `vault/` and rebuilds it from `raw/`, so nothing is summarised, rewritten, or
> accumulated. The vault is always exactly "what the app holds today", and every claim traces back to
> a raw JSON record.

## The components

| Component | What it is | Edit? |
|---|---|---|
| **App + API** | `ji.jivo.in` (React/Vite PWA) → `https://factory.jivo.in/api/v1` (Django REST + SimpleJWT). Health: `/accounts/me/`. Every call carries `Company-Code: JIVO_MART` (missing → `403`). | upstream |
| **`jivo-factory-pp-cli`** | The read-only CLI (built by "printing-press"; source `/root/printing-press/library/jivo-factory`). **19 resources · 152 GET endpoints.** Bearer JWT + `Company-Code: JIVO_MART`. No mutations. | spec in `spec.yaml` |
| **`bin/capture.py`** | Lossless capture of the 152 verified endpoints (`research/get200.txt`). Probes DRF pagination first; walks every page (`paginated_list`) or plain-GETs to `list`/`object`. Writes `raw/<slug>.json` as `{endpoint,kind,count,data}` + `raw/_manifest.json`. 8 worker threads. Deterministic. | `bin/` |
| **`bin/capture_gaps.py`** | Cap-buster + missed-domain backfill — runs **after** capture.py, overwrites/adds raw files in the same shape. Adds the `person-gatein` domain + `company/companies`; busts the 200-cap on sales-dispatch documents (→1130) and the `oitm` item master (→~420); re-pulls QC/production SAP-items via search proxies (→193 each). **Does NOT update `_manifest.json`.** | `bin/` |
| **`bin/render.py`** | The authority on what the vault *is*. Deterministic full-replace render: scans `raw/*.json` directly, classifies by `kind`, emits one note per record, the `_HOME.md` MOC, per-entity `_moc-*.md` hubs, `render-proof.json`, and the SAP bridge `vault/_bridge.json`. | `bin/` |
| **`vault/`** | The rendered Obsidian source vault — **49,461** `.md` (49,371 notes + 89 MOCs + `_HOME.md`) + `_bridge.json`. Becomes `jivo-data-bank/factory/` on fusion. | **never** (regenerated) |
| **Fusion — `factory_pillar.py`** | Lives in the **data-bank** repo (`/opt/ecom-intel/bin/factory_pillar.py`), not here. Copies `vault/` verbatim into the combined vault and appends a `## Factory lens` to product nodes by `FG####`. | data-bank repo |

The CLI, `raw/`, and `vault/` are this repo's responsibility; the fusion belongs to the data bank and
is documented here only for the seam.

## The refresh pipeline

Orchestrated by `bin/factory_refresh.sh` (`set -euo pipefail`, single-flight `flock -n .refresh.lock`),
a deterministic **full REPLACE** that runs at **05:30 IST**:

```
 1. refresh_token.py      POST the stored refresh token → /accounts/token/refresh/
        │                   server ROTATES it → store fresh access + fresh refresh (0600)
        ▼
 2. capture.py            GET all 152 endpoints → raw/<slug>.json  ({endpoint,kind,count,data})
        │                   probes DRF pagination, walks pages, writes _manifest.json (pre-gap)
        ▼
 3. capture_gaps.py       cap-bust + missed-domain backfill → raw/ (overwrites/adds; manifest NOT updated)
        │                   person-gatein domain · company · sales-dispatch docs 1130 · oitm 420 · sap-items 193
        ▼
 4. render.py             if isdir(vault): shutil.rmtree(vault)  → then rebuild from raw/*.json
        │                   one note per record · _HOME.md · _moc-*.md hubs · render-proof.json · _bridge.json
        ▼
   git commit (history = time machine)   ── pushed every 3h ──►  PUBLIC repo

   ─────────────────────  separate repo, ~13:30 IST  ─────────────────────
   data-bank daily_rebuild.sh → factory_pillar.py: copy vault/ verbatim into jivo-data-bank/factory/
   + append "## Factory lens" to product nodes by FG#### + fail-closed verify → commit (owner pushes)
```

**Fail-closed at every stage.** Each stage aborts the whole run on failure, with a Telegram alert via
`/root/.claude/hooks/notify.sh`. Exit codes: **2** auth dead, **3** capture failed, **4** gaps failed,
**5** render failed. A bad run never commits — the previous day's commit stays live ("rather ship
correct-yesterday than wrong-today").

> **`factory_daily.sh` is a self-contained alternative** (refresh → run the data-bank
> `daily_rebuild.sh` → optional push) that is **NOT used by cron** — the data-bank's own cron does the
> fuse + commit + push. Auto-push there is OFF by default (`FACTORY_AUTOPUSH=1` to enable).

---

## Full-replace semantics & where history lives

- `render.py` does `shutil.rmtree(vault)` then rebuilds from `raw/`. **Nothing accumulates inside the
  vault** — every refresh is a complete, current-state mirror. The downstream data-bank rebuild is
  likewise a full REPLACE.
- **History lives only in git commits.** Each refresh produces one commit, so **git history is the
  time machine**: any past day's gate / box / dispatch / inventory state is recoverable by checking
  out that day's commit. Nothing else preserves the past.
- **Corollary — never hand-edit the vault.** A manual edit to any note, `_moc-*.md`, `_HOME.md`, or
  `_bridge.json` is wiped by the next 05:30 refresh. Fix `bin/render.py` and re-render.
- `render.py` reads `raw/*.json` **directly** (skipping `_manifest.json`), so it is robust to gap
  re-captures the manifest doesn't list — the vault reflects the *post-gap* raw, which is why it has
  entities/counts the manifest doesn't show.

---

## Auth model

Self-sustaining, no password at rest.

- Tokens live at `~/.config/jivo-factory/` — `access.jwt` (~25h, `access_expires_in: 90000`) and
  `refresh.jwt` (~7d, `refresh_expires_in: 604800`), mode **0600**, outside the repo tree.
- **`refresh_token.py`** POSTs the stored refresh token to `/accounts/token/refresh/`. The server
  **rotates** the refresh token, so each run stores **both** a fresh access AND a fresh refresh token.
  Run daily ⇒ auth self-sustains **forever** without the password.
- **Grace:** `factory_refresh.sh` tolerates a failed refresh as long as `/accounts/me/` still returns
  200 (logs a WARN, captures anyway). It hard-fails (exit 2) + alerts only when access is **also** dead.
- **`reseed.sh`** is the one-time re-seed (only if cron has been down > 7d, or for the first seed). The
  owner runs it with the `!` prefix so the password stays in their shell:
  `! JIVO_FACTORY_EMAIL=… JIVO_FACTORY_PASSWORD=… bash bin/reseed.sh`. It logs in once at
  `/accounts/login/` and writes access + refresh (0600). **The password is never stored** (cardinal rule).

---

## Push & sync

- **`/root/bin/push_all_jivo.sh`** (cron **`45 */3`**, every 3 hours) does `git add -A` and pushes this
  repo's completed work. The repo is **PUBLIC** (`github.com/daman8271/jivo-factory-intel`).
- Because it is a public proprietary-data repo, the data-exfiltration classifier **blocks Claude from
  pushing it** — the owner pushes (or `push_all_jivo.sh` does on the cron).
- **Fusion path:** the data-bank's `factory_pillar.py` is the only consumer of `vault/` + `_bridge.json`.
  It `copytree`s `vault/` into `/opt/ecom-intel/combined-vault/factory` (verbatim, sha256 zero-loss
  proof), appends the `## Factory lens` to product nodes by `FG####`, then the build is rsynced into
  `/root/jivo-data-bank` and committed. See [`DATA-MODEL.md`](DATA-MODEL.md) § Cross-repo for the seam.

---

## Failure modes & guards

- **Single-flight:** `flock -n .refresh.lock` — a second refresh can't overlap the first.
- **Stage abort + alert:** exit **2** (auth dead) / **3** (capture) / **4** (gaps) / **5** (render),
  each Telegram-alerting; no commit on failure.
- **Partial-render risk:** `render.py` is all-or-nothing within a run (`rmtree` then rebuild), and the
  orchestrator aborts on any stage failure, so a half-built vault shouldn't ship. But **there is no
  within-repo note-count regression baseline** — the zero-loss gate and count checks live downstream in
  `factory_pillar.py` / `verify_databank.py`. This repo's own integrity proof is `render-proof.json`
  (counts) plus the downstream sha256 manifest.
- **Pre-gap manifest:** `_manifest.json` reflects the BEFORE-gap inventory (oitm 100, sales-dispatch
  documents 200, QC/prod sap-items 0, no person-gatein, no company). Don't quote it as final — quote
  `render-proof.json`.

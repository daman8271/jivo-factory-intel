# JIVO Factory Intel — Jivo Mart (ji.jivo.in)

> **🌐 Public repo, internal data — by design.** This repository is **public**
> (`github.com/daman8271/jivo-factory-intel`) and contains internal Jivo Mart / SAP
> factory-floor data made world-readable by the owner's explicit, informed choice. **No
> credentials or secrets are committed** — JWTs live in `~/.config/jivo-factory/` *outside* the
> tree, and `*.jwt`, `*.env`, `config.toml`, `*secret*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.log` are gitignored.
> Because it is public, treat every change as world-visible: never let a new credential, token, or
> private export land here.

A lossless capture of the **`ji.jivo.in` factory-floor app** for the **Jivo Mart** company
(`JIVO_MART`) — the read-only CLI pulls every record the app exposes, a deterministic renderer turns
it into a **linked Obsidian source vault** (one note per record, foreign keys as `[[wikilinks]]`),
and that vault becomes the **4th pillar** of the JIVO data bank. One note per gate arrival, vehicle,
driver, barcode box, pallet, scan, dispatch, inspection, SAP item — joined into one connected graph,
**keyed by the SAP item code `FG####`**. **The lossless graph is the deliverable — not a dashboard.**

## Start here — reading order

Read these four files **in order** (~10 minutes) and you have the whole foundation: what this is,
how it's built, how to read it, and what it means.

1. **`README.md`** ← you are here — what this is, the at-a-glance numbers, the rules.
2. **[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md)** — how it's built: the CLI, the capture/render pipeline,
   the daily refresh, full-replace semantics, and the git-history time machine.
3. **[`VAULT-GUIDE.md`](VAULT-GUIDE.md)** — how to **read & navigate**: folder layout, the anatomy
   of a note, the MOC hubs, the SAP bridge, and the navigation recipes.
4. **[`DATA-MODEL.md`](DATA-MODEL.md)** — what the data **means**: Jivo Mart's business, the 46-entity
   catalog, the foreign-key graph, the SAP bridge, and what is *not* modeled.

**Also in this repo:** **[`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md)** (the phased plan that built this) ·
**[`REFRESH-RUNBOOK.md`](REFRESH-RUNBOOK.md)** (the daily auto-refresh runbook + one-time re-seed).

## The honest gaps (read before drawing conclusions)

This is a real dataset with real limits. The full discussion is in
**[`DATA-MODEL.md`](DATA-MODEL.md) § What's NOT modeled**; the headlines:

- **`object`-kind endpoints are captured but NOT rendered as notes.** Of the 152 endpoints, **49** are
  single-object responses (dashboards, summaries, options, WMS overviews, SAP plan-dashboards,
  production analytics, inventory-age report, intercompany dashboard). They are saved losslessly to
  `raw/*.json` but get **no vault notes** — honest lossiness, raw JSON retained.
- **`vault-schema.md` is ASPIRATIONAL, not as-built.** That 71 KB doc describes a much richer/prettier
  vault (pretty domain folders like `fleet-gate/`, `barcode/`, `production/`; dozens of entities) that
  **`render.py` never builds**. The shipped vault is **flat `domain__entity` slug folders, 46 entity
  types**. Trust `render.py` / `render-proof.json`, not `vault-schema.md`.
- **Production, Maintenance, inbound-QC and GRPO modules are built but dormant.** Jivo Mart does not
  manufacture — it receives finished cartons and dispatches them — so the MES/CMMS/goods-receipt
  muscles return `count:0` (the **59** empty modules). Schema-complete, zero master data.
- **`_manifest.json` is the PRE-gap inventory.** `capture_gaps.py` adds/overwrites raw files after
  `capture.py` but does **not** update the manifest. Quote `render-proof.json` for final counts, not
  the manifest.

---

## Hard rules

- **Read-only — no mutation.** The CLI and pipeline only GET. There are no write/mutation commands;
  do not add any without explicit approval.
- **Never write secrets** (the Jivo Factory password, a JWT) into any file, doc, or commit. Tokens
  live at `~/.config/jivo-factory/` (mode 0600) and self-sustain via the rotating refresh token; the
  password is never stored (cardinal rule).
- **It is PUBLIC — be doubly careful.** Nothing sensitive (a new credential, a private export) may
  ever land in the tree. The defensive `.gitignore` is a backstop, not a license to be careless.
- **Never hand-edit the vault.** `render.py` wipes and rebuilds `vault/` on the **next daily refresh**,
  so any manual edit to a note, MOC, or `_bridge.json` is silently lost. Change `bin/render.py` and
  re-render instead.
- **Accuracy at all costs — fail-closed.** A bad capture / gap-pull / render aborts **without
  committing** and Telegram-alerts; the previous day's commit stays live. Rather ship correct-yesterday
  than wrong-today.

## Where this fits — the JIVO data-bank programme

This is **one source pillar** of a four-repo programme. Three source repos each capture a system; the
fourth fuses them per product, keyed by the SAP code **`FG####`**:

1. **`/root/jivo-intel`** (`daman8271/jivo-intel`) → pillar **`jivo/`** — the `ecom.jivo.in` internal
   app: SKUs, POs, dashboards, targets, volume (~34,750 notes). Keys products by SAP code `sku-FG…`.
2. **`/opt/ecom-intel`** (`daman8271/ecom-intel`) → pillar **`ecom/`** — the competitor-price scraper:
   per-SKU price-match history across platforms. Keys products by name-slug `canonical_sku`.
3. **`/root/jivo-factory-intel`** (**this repo**, CLI `jivo-factory-pp-cli`) → pillar **`factory/`** —
   the `ji.jivo.in` factory app for Jivo Mart. Keys every item by SAP item code **`FG####`** (`item_code`).
4. **`/root/jivo-data-bank`** (`daman8271/jivo-data-bank`) — the **fusion repo**: copies all three
   pillars verbatim and appends one node per product with **three lenses** (competitor-price ·
   JIVO-volume · factory). The factory lens is bridged here by `FG####`.

---

## Refresh & ownership

- **05:30 IST** — `bin/factory_refresh.sh` refreshes this repo (rotate token → capture → cap-bust →
  full-replace render). Self-sustaining auth, no password at rest.
- **Event-driven after the noon upstream chain** — the data-bank fusion runs after the 12:00 ecom
  deadline sweep and competitor refresh complete; typical landing is around **12:20 IST**, not a fixed
  06:00 or 13:30 cron.
- **Every 15 minutes** — `/root/bin/push_all_repos.sh` runs from cron with `COMMIT_VAULTS=1` and syncs
  completed crawler/scraper output for the owner's Jivo repos.

Operational detail (the cron chain, self-sustaining auth, the one-time re-seed) lives in
**[`REFRESH-RUNBOOK.md`](REFRESH-RUNBOOK.md)**.

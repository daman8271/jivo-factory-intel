# Jivo Mart Factory App — Whole-App Model
> Synthesis of the 13 section studies. Tenant in scope: **Jivo Mart (JIVO_MART)** only. Live-verified 2026-06-30 against `factory.jivo.in/api/v1`.

## 1. What the app IS

`factory.jivo.in` is a **factory-floor operating system and SAP Business One (SAP-B1) companion**. It is the digital control tower that wraps a physical edible-oil plant: it governs who and what enters/leaves the gate, inspects inbound material, posts goods receipts into SAP, tracks finished-goods inventory across 31 warehouses, labels and traces every carton, and runs the scan-to-ship dispatch of trucks — all while reading from and writing back to a SAP-B1 ERP (item master, GRPO, AR invoices, inventory transfers, production orders).

It is **multi-tenant across three sibling companies** that share one SAP system and one physical complex:
- **Jivo Oil** (`JIVO_OIL`) — the manufacturer (out of scope here)
- **Jivo Beverages** (`JIVO_BEVERAGES`) — beverages arm (out of scope here)
- **Jivo Mart** (`JIVO_MART`) — **the retail / dispatch arm, the subject of this model**

Every API call is scoped by a `Company-Code: JIVO_MART` header. A few surfaces are deliberately shared across all three tenants (notably the cross-company **vehicle Arrivals** weighbridge log and the **intercompany barcode transfer** rail), but everything else in this document is Jivo Mart's slice.

The critical fact that shapes everything below: **Jivo Mart does not really manufacture.** It receives finished, already-barcoded cartons from Jivo Oil via an intercompany transfer rail, holds them in warehouses, and dispatches them to customers. So the app's *inbound-logistics, inventory, labelling, and outbound-dispatch* muscles are heavily exercised, while its *production (MES) and maintenance (CMMS)* muscles are built but idle.

The app is organized into **13 sections**, mapped to physical factory stages plus three cross-cutting layers (Admin, Dashboards, Notifications).

## 2. The physical factory flow (end-to-end)

The 13 sections line up along the path a vehicle and its goods take through the plant. There are two main material directions — **inbound** (supplier/intercompany goods coming in) and **outbound** (finished goods shipping out) — bridged by the warehouse.

```

  ════════════════════════════ INBOUND (raw / packaging material) ════════════════════════════
   Supplier truck arrives
        │
   [GATE]  ARV- arrival (weighbridge tare) ──► GE- raw-material gate-in

  ════════════════════════════ THE TWILIGHT OF "PRODUCTION" ══════════════════════════════════
   [PRODUCTION (MES)]  — for Jivo Mart this stage is NOT run in-house.
        Finished goods are manufactured by JIVO_OIL and handed over via the
        intercompany BARCODE rail (see below). MES exists but is unconfigured.

  ════════════════════════════ OUTBOUND (finished goods) ═════════════════════════════════════
   [BARCODE]  JIVO_OIL → JIVO_MART intercompany transfer (boxes BOX-…, pallets PLT-… become Mart stock)
        │      every carton tracked CREATE → PALLETIZE → (TRANSFER) → DISPATCH
        ▼
   [WAREHOUSE / WMS]  stock sits in BH-PF/BH-FGM, then SAP inventory transfers relay it
        │              to regional warehouses (BH-FGM→DL-INT→DL-FG, DL-MP→DL-EC, …)
        ▼
   SAP AR invoice created
        │
   [DISPATCH]  DispatchPlan BOOKED → empty truck called in
        │
   [GATE]  EVGI- empty-vehicle gate-in (Vehicle Management identifies the truck)
        │
   [DISPATCH / BARCODE]  DOCKV- docking session → scan-to-ship every box against the invoice
        │                 → truck photo → weighment → QR gatepass (DCK/JIVO_MART/2026-27/…)
        ▼
   [GATE]  DOCK- sales-dispatch gate-out committed → truck DEPARTS
        │
   [DISPATCH / GRPO]  post-dispatch accounting: bilty-GRPO (freight service GRPO) → transporter AP invoice
```

| 05 | **Vehicle Management** | Master registry of vehicles/drivers/transporters + entry log | Vehicles (340), Drivers (296), Transporters (88), Types (7) | **Data-rich** (masters); only RAW_MATERIAL entry type active |
| 06 | **Quality Control** | Inbound material inspection (arrival slips) + production QC | 8 arrival slips (all packaging, all NOT_STARTED) | **Barely used** — inbound stuck in QC limbo; production QC empty |
| 07 | **GRPO** | SAP goods-receipt posting: material (inbound) + service (freight) | Material entries (5, all QC_PENDING), service pending (6) | **Barely used** — 0 GRPOs posted (material or service) |
| 08 | **Production** | MES: planning + execution (runs, OEE, breakdowns, waste) | 1 historical SAP order; production-movement report (live) | **Largely empty** — 0 lines/runs; only SAP-side reports populated |
| 09 | **Maintenance** | CMMS: assets, work orders, PM plans, spares, vendor visits | Full enum schema + 43 users; everything else 0 | **Empty** — schema-complete, zero master data entered |
| 10 | **Warehouse** | Finished-goods WMS: dashboard, stock, billing, transfers, FG receipts, BOM | 268 SKUs, ₹9.96 cr, 953 stock rows, 757 billing items | **Data-rich** (read side); FG receipts + BOM requests empty |
| 11 | **WMS** | Same backend as Warehouse — inventory control tower over 31 warehouses | Dashboard, stock overview, batch expiry (300), SO backlog (86) | **Data-rich**; batch-expiry dates blank, min-stock benchmarks all 0 |
| 12 | **Barcode** | FG track-and-trace + scan-to-ship + intercompany transfer | Boxes (27,206), Pallets (583), Scans (15,031), IC transfers (1,017) | **Most data-rich section in the app** |
| 13 | **Notifications** | Event alert backbone (in-app inbox + FCM push) | 39 event types; inbox (135, all gate person-entry) | **Data-rich infra**; this account sees only gate events |

> **Note — Warehouse vs WMS:** sections 10 and 11 are two documents over **one backend** (`/warehouse/wms/*`). "Warehouse" also covers the write-side stubs (`/warehouse/fg-receipts/`, `/warehouse/bom-requests/`, `/warehouse/stock/check/`); "WMS" is the read-side inventory cockpit. They report the same headline numbers (268 SKUs, ₹9.96 cr, 31 warehouses, 953 stock rows).

## 4. Cross-section data-flow graph

The sections hand off to each other along a small number of **shared keys**. The integer `DispatchPlan.plan_id`, the SAP `doc_num`/`doc_entry`, and the family of `entry_no` prefixes are the joins that stitch the whole app together.

**The load-bearing joins:**

| Bridge key | Connects | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `DispatchPlan.plan_id` | Dispatch pipeline ⇄ Barcode dispatch session ⇄ Gate `DOCK-` ⇄ GRPO service entry | plan 690 = `DOCK-20260629-0022` = invoice 706260665 |
| SAP `doc_num` / `doc_entry` | Everything ⇄ SAP-B1 | AR invoice `706260665`; PO `426224589`; transfer `626674697` |
| `entry_no` prefix family | Gate ⇄ Vehicle Mgmt ⇄ QC ⇄ GRPO ⇄ Dispatch | `ARV-`, `EVGI-`, `EVGO-`, `DOCKV-`, `DOCK-`, `GE-` |

| `User.id` (Admin) | identity backbone for every audit field | `created_by`, `requested_by`, `reviewed_by`, `scanned_by` |

The **Arrivals** (`ARV-`) record is the one shared multi-tenant artifact: a single physical truck can carry gate-ins and gate-outs for JIVO_MART, JIVO_OIL, and JIVO_BEVERAGES under one arrival number.

## 5. The SAP-B1 integration story

The app is, at its core, a **floor-level front-end and workflow engine bolted onto SAP Business One**. SAP holds the books of record (item master, inventory, accounting documents); the factory app captures the physical reality (who scanned what, which truck, which weighment) and posts the resulting documents back into SAP.

**SAP objects the app reads and writes:**

| SAP-B1 object | Role in the app | Where it surfaces |
|---|---|---|
| **OITM** (item master) | Authoritative FG/PM/RM catalogue; batch-management flags | `/barcode/items/oitm/` (group 102, `manage_batch_numbers=true`); item codes everywhere |
| **OINM** (inventory movement ledger) | Source for live + historical stock | WMS stock, `/dashboards/stock/as-of/` (point-in-time reconstruction) |
| **GRPO** (Goods Receipt PO) | Inbound material receipt **and** outbound freight service receipt | GRPO section (material → warehouse + AP; service → freight expense) |
| **AR Invoice / Delivery** (tx types 13/15) | Outbound sales documents that drive dispatch | Dispatch (`sap_doc_num`), barcode dispatch sessions, WMS `AR_INVOICE` movements |
| **Inventory Transfer** (tx type 67) | Inter-warehouse stock relays + BST source docs | WMS transfers (chained doc pairs); Gate BST (50 eligible SAP docs) |
| **Production Order** | Plan/component-shortfall view | `/sap/plan-dashboard/` (1 historical order for Mart) |
| **AP Invoice** (tx type 18) | Transporter freight billing | Dispatch transporter-invoices (not yet posted) |
| **GL accounts / tax codes / branches** | Posting configuration | `/grpo/service/options/`, `/dispatch/bilty-grpo/options/` (8 branches, 24 tax codes, ~400–992 GL accounts) |
| **Vendor (VENDA-) / Customer (CUSTA-)** masters | Party identity on receipts/invoices | GRPO suppliers, WMS sales-order backlog |

**Document-number model:** SAP exposes every document with two ids — `doc_entry` (internal numeric primary key, e.g. `5041`) and `doc_num` (the human-facing number printed on paperwork, e.g. PO `426224589`, invoice `706260665`). The app consistently carries both, using `doc_entry` for linkage and `doc_num` for display. Posting a GRPO returns a fresh `sap_doc_num` that the app stores back on its own record.

**Intercompany model:** Jivo Oil, Jivo Mart, and Jivo Beverages are distinct SAP company databases (each with its own HANA schema, e.g. `JIVO_MART_HANADB`). Finished goods move between them as **intercompany barcode transfers** — Jivo Oil scans boxes out, they appear in Jivo Mart's inventory with full cross-company trace (`MANUFACTURED@JIVO_OIL → SCANNED → TRANSFER_COMPLETED@JIVO_MART`). The GL/customer masters even carry per-state intercompany accounts (`JIVO MART PVT LTD - DL/HR/PB/KT/RJ/UP`).

**Important integration gaps for Jivo Mart (where the app runs ahead of SAP write-back):**
- **Barcode dispatch SAP sync is `NOT_CONFIGURED`** — scan-to-ship sessions complete *internally* without writing the delivery back to SAP-B1. The app records the physical dispatch; SAP reconciliation happens by another path.
- **Intercompany transfers** carry `sap_enabled: false` — the box ownership change is tracked in-app, not mirrored as a SAP transfer.
- **No material GRPO has ever been posted** (5 entries stuck in QC); **no service GRPO posted** (6 pending) — the SAP write step at the end of both inbound and freight chains is queued but unexercised.
- **`production-release-oil`** points at a HANA table (`PRODUCTION_RELEASE_OIL`) that doesn't exist in the Mart schema — broken for this tenant.
- The **Sales-Planning-vs-Requirement** dashboard's SAP HANA stored procedure explicitly supports only `JIVO_OIL` and `JIVO_BEVERAGES` — never runs for Mart.

## 6. What Jivo Mart actually uses heavily vs barely

Jivo Mart is the **retail / dispatch arm**, not a manufacturer. That single fact predicts the entire data-presence pattern: the **outbound-logistics spine is fully alive**, while **in-house production and plant-maintenance are dormant**, and the **inbound-receipt chain is configured but stalled**.

### Heavily used (live, high-volume operational data)

- **Barcode** — the busiest section in the app: **27,206 boxes**, **583 pallets**, **15,031 scan events**, **57 dispatch sessions**, **1,017 intercompany transfers** (994 from Jivo Oil = 353,790 PCS — this is Mart's *de facto* "production intake").
- **Gate (outbound + persons)** — **38 `DOCK-` dispatches** (35 departed), **117 arrivals**, **36 `EVGI-` empty-vehicle gate-ins**, **206 person entries / 149 visitors**. The FG gate-out workflow is the daily heartbeat.
- **Vehicle Management** — **340 vehicles, 296 drivers, 88 transporters** continuously referenced by every gate and dispatch event.
- **Dispatch** — **19 plans**, **38 docking entries**, **6 bilty-GRPO** in flight; the pipeline cycles fully on dispatch days.
- **Warehouse / WMS (read side)** — **268 SKUs / ₹9.96 cr** on hand, **953 stock-overview rows**, **757 billing-reconciliation items** (₹236 cr received cumulative), **86 open sales orders**, **14 active inter-warehouse transfers**. Rich, live, daily.
- **Dashboards** — stock levels (43,575 rows), dispatch pipeline, inventory age all render live.
- **Admin** — **62 users**, and the **scan-exception approval queues** are a routine daily step (33 approvals, all signed off by one reviewer, EP000) because Mart is migrating old pre-barcode stock.
- **Notifications** — live infra (135 inbox records, FCM push), though this account sees only gate person-entry events.

### Barely used / unconfigured (built but idle for Jivo Mart)

- **Production (MES)** — **0 lines, 0 machines, 0 runs, 0 breakdowns, 0 waste**. Only the SAP-side `plan-dashboard` (1 old order) and the `production-movement` report (SAP OINM mirror) have data. *Manufacturing is Jivo Oil's job; Mart doesn't run the floor.*
- **Maintenance (CMMS)** — **fully schema-complete but entirely empty**: 0 assets, 0 work orders, 0 PM plans, 0 spares, 0 vendor visits. Only the options enum + 43-user list return data. Awaiting first onboarding.
- **Quality Control** — **8 packaging-material arrival slips, all stuck NOT_STARTED since May 2026**; production QC, material-type masters, and parameter library all empty. The chemist workflow is effectively unexercised.
- **GRPO (both flows)** — **0 documents posted**. 5 material entries blocked at QC, 6 service entries awaiting bilty. The end-of-chain SAP posting step is queued but never completed.
- **WMS operational/config gaps** — `fg-receipts` and `bom-requests` empty (no in-house production to feed them); **batch-expiry dates blank on all 300 batches**; **min-stock benchmarks are 0 for all 43,575 items** (so every stock health flag reads "none"); inventory-age `effective_date` pinned to a single seed date.
- **Gate inbound sub-flows** — BST, job-work, rejected-materials, customer-returns, repair-parts, construction, fixed-assets, daily-needs and maintenance gate-ins are all **0** (several have no server endpoint at all). Only raw-material gate-in (via the QC/GRPO `GE-` path) and person access are live.

### One-line synthesis of the pattern

> Jivo Mart runs the app as a **finished-goods receiving-and-dispatch hub**: cartons arrive pre-made and pre-barcoded from Jivo Oil over the intercompany rail, get held and relayed across 31 warehouses, then scanned onto trucks and gated out against SAP invoices. The manufacturing, maintenance, inbound-QC, and GRPO-posting modules are present and schema-complete but largely dormant — because, for this tenant, those activities happen elsewhere (Jivo Oil) or simply haven't been switched on yet.

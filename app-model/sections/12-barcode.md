# Barcode — Jivo Mart app-model
> Last documented: 2026-06-30. Jivo Mart (JIVO_MART) only.

## 1. Purpose — what this section is for in the factory

The Barcode section is the core **finished-goods track-and-trace and outbound dispatch** system for Jivo Mart's factory. Every carton that comes off the production line gets a barcode label. From that moment until the box ships to a customer, this section records where it is and what happened to it.

Specifically, the section handles:

- **Box lifecycle** — generating, printing, and tracking carton-level barcodes (`BOX-...`) from production through warehouse stock to dispatch.
- **Pallet lifecycle** — grouping boxes onto pallet barcodes (`PLT-...`) for efficient warehouse movement and dispatch.
- **Sales dispatch** — scan-to-ship workflow tied to SAP AR invoices (sales bills); operators scan boxes/pallets on the loading dock to verify every line is fulfilled before the truck leaves.
- **Intercompany transfers** — boxes manufactured by Jivo Oil (`JIVO_OIL`) are transferred to Jivo Mart's inventory via barcode scan; boxes can also be returned.
- **Repack and dismantle** — partial-carton repack (when damaged boxes need consolidation) and box dismantle operations.
- **Print management** — label reprints and bulk printing via a TSC DA310 label printer.
- **Traceability** — full audit trail of every movement event (CREATE → PALLETIZE → DISPATCH, or CREATE → TRANSFER_COMPLETED etc.) per barcode, and cross-company trace.

As of 2026-06-30 the section has **27,206 box barcodes** and **583 pallet barcodes** in the system, with **1,017 intercompany transfers** completed and **57 dispatch sessions** open/completed against SAP invoices.

}
```

**Data presence:** 27,206 total boxes — 26,604 ACTIVE, 596 DISPATCHED, 4 DISMANTLED. Warehouses: `BH-PF` and `BH-FGM`.

---

### 3.2 Box detail — `/barcode/boxes/:boxId`

**Purpose:** Full detail for one carton: item info, current location, full movement history, and links to any repack or dismantle events.

**API endpoint:** `GET /barcode/boxes/{id}/`

**Key fields (extra vs. list):**

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `movements[]` | Ordered list of movement events: `CREATE`, `PALLETIZE`, `DISPATCH`, `TRANSFER` etc. Each has `from_warehouse`, `to_warehouse`, `performed_by`, `performed_at` |

repacked_from: [{source_box: BOX-20260612-XX-4324, qty: 8}]
```

---

### 3.3 Box generate — `/barcode/boxes/generate/`

**Purpose:** Operator creates new box barcodes for a production batch. Typically triggered after a production run completes. The form takes item code, batch number, manufacture/expiry dates, quantity per box, and box count; the system mints `BOX-YYYYMMDD-XX-NNNN` barcodes in sequence and queues them for printing.

**API endpoint:** `POST /barcode/boxes/` (write operation; not tested read-only).

**Data presence:** Page is functional — boxes are generated daily. The `created_by_name: "Barcode"` entries in the box list indicate system/automated generation from production.

---

### 3.4 Pallet list — `/barcode/pallets/`

```

**Data presence:** 583 pallets total — 564 ACTIVE, 13 DISPATCHED, 1 CLEARED. All in `BH-PF` (1 in `BH-CRUDE`).

---

### 3.5 Pallet detail — `/barcode/pallets/:palletId`

**Purpose:** Detailed view of a single pallet: all boxes currently on it, dispatch linkage.

**API endpoint:** `GET /barcode/pallets/{id}/`

**Extra fields vs. list:** `boxes[]` — full list of all box records assigned to this pallet (same schema as box list entries).

**Live sample (pallet 3122):** Returns 36 box records for FIRST PRESSED MUSTARD OIL 1 LTR 20 PCS, all ACTIVE, batch L4 006647, each box has 20 PCS.

---

### 3.6 Pallet create — `/barcode/pallets/create/`

**Purpose:** Operator creates a new pallet barcode (mints `PLT-YYYYMMDD-XX-NNN`) before stacking boxes onto it.

**API endpoint:** `POST /barcode/pallets/` (write; not tested read-only).

---

### 3.7 Print history — `/barcode/print/history/`

**Purpose:** Audit trail of every label print event: what was printed, by whom, on which printer, and whether it was an initial print or reprint.

**API endpoint:** `GET /barcode/print/history/` (paginated)

**Key fields:**

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `label_type` | `BOX` or `PALLET` |
| `reference_code` | The barcode printed (e.g. `BOX-20260629-XX-4004`) |
| `print_type` | `INITIAL` (first print) or `REPRINT` |
| `reprint_reason` | Reason code for reprint (numeric) |
| `printed_by_name` | Operator name |
| `printed_at` | Timestamp |

  "reference_code": "BOX-20260629-XX-4004",
  "print_type": "REPRINT",
  "reprint_reason": "33",
  "printed_by_name": "Jassi",
  "printed_at": "2026-06-29T15:54:02+05:30",
  "printer_name": "TSC DA310"
}
```

**Data presence:** 16 records; all are `BOX` type `REPRINT` on `TSC DA310`. The relatively small count (16) compared to 27,206 boxes suggests initial prints are not all logged here, or pagination is limited in the display window.

---

### 3.8 Scan history — `/barcode/scan/history/`

**Purpose:** Complete audit log of every barcode scan across the system: scan type, barcode raw value, parse result, operator, device (browser UA).

**API endpoint:** `GET /barcode/scan/history/` (paginated)

**Key fields:**

  "scanned_at": "2026-06-29T20:24:25+05:30"
}
```

**Data presence:** 15,031 records. All observed scan_types are `SHIP`, all context is `SALES_DISPATCH`. Operators use Android mobile devices.

---

### 3.9 Dispatch sessions — `/barcode/dispatch/sessions/`

**Purpose:** Manage the scan-to-ship sessions that verify boxes against SAP sales invoices before dispatch. Each session is linked to one AR invoice (bill_number / sap_doc_num). Tabs: Active, Closed, Completed.

**API endpoint:**
- `GET /barcode/dispatch/sessions/active/` — sessions being scanned right now
- `GET /barcode/dispatch/sessions/completed/` — fully scanned and dispatched
- `GET /barcode/dispatch/sessions/closed/` — manually closed without completing

**Session status lifecycle:** `DRAFT` → `PARTIAL` → `READY_TO_DISPATCH` → `ACTIVE` (scanning) → `COMPLETED` → dispatched; or `CLOSED` (manual close).

**Key session fields:**

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `bill_number` | SAP AR Invoice number (e.g. `706260331`) |
| `sap_doc_entry` | SAP internal doc entry |
| `delivery_number` | SAP delivery number |
| `customer_code` / `customer_name` | Customer |

| `bill_date` | Invoice date |
| `status` | `DRAFT`, `PARTIAL`, `READY_TO_DISPATCH`, `ACTIVE`, `COMPLETED`, `CLOSED`, `CANCELLED` |
| `total_expected_qty` | Total PCS expected per SAP lines |
| `total_scanned_qty` | PCS confirmed by scan so far |
| `pending_qty` | Still to scan |
| `accepted_scan_count` | Accepted barcode scans |
| `rejected_scan_count` | Rejected scans (wrong item, not found, etc.) |
| `pallet_scan_count` | Pallets scanned (one pallet = many boxes) |
| `box_scan_count` | Individual boxes scanned |
| `lines[]` | One line per SAP invoice line: material_code, bill_qty, scanned_qty, status |
| `scanned_units[]` | Every accepted scan unit: box_barcode, item, batch, qty, warehouse, scanned_by |
| `can_dispatch` | Whether the session is ready to dispatch |
| `sap_sync_status` | `NOT_CONFIGURED` for all Jivo Mart sessions (SAP sync disabled) |

**Live sample (completed session 118):**
```
bill: 706260331  customer: R K WORLDINFOCOM PVT LTD  Gurugram
date: 2026-06-15  status: COMPLETED
total_expected_qty: 4220 PCS  total_scanned_qty: 4220 PCS
lines: 1 (COLD PRESS SUNFLOWER 1 LTR 20 PCS, 211 boxes of 20 PCS)
accepted_scan_count: 16 (pallets)  pallet_scan_count: 5  box_scan_count: 211
dispatched_by: Sonu  dispatched_at: 2026-06-17T16:42
```

**Live sample (active session 188):**
```
bill: 706260740  customer: R K WORLDINFOCOM PVT LTD  Haryana
date: 2026-06-25  status: ACTIVE  started_at: 2026-06-26
total_expected_qty: 2000 PCS  total_scanned_qty: 0 PCS  (scanning not yet begun)
lines: 1 (COLD PRESS SUNFLOWER 1 LTR 20 PCS, 100 boxes)
can_scan: true  can_dispatch: false
```

**Data presence (57 sessions total):** DRAFT=19, PARTIAL=24, READY_TO_DISPATCH=11, ACTIVE=1, COMPLETED=2. Closed=0. SAP sync disabled for all (`NOT_CONFIGURED`).

---

### 3.10 Dispatch settings — `/barcode/dispatch/settings/`

**Purpose:** Global configuration for the dispatch scanning workflow.

**API endpoint:** `GET /barcode/dispatch/settings/` (single object)

**Live data:**
```json
{
  "allow_partial_dispatch": true,
  "allow_partial_pallet_dispatch": true,
  "allow_box_dispatch_from_pallet": true,
  "require_sequential_item_scanning": true,
  "require_sap_sync_on_completion": true,
  "allow_manual_close": true,
  "allow_admin_override": false,
  "created_at": "2026-06-01T14:53:07+05:30",
  "updated_at": "2026-06-22T17:17:46+05:30"
}
```

Key implications: sequential item scanning is enforced (one line must be fully scanned before the next); SAP sync is required on completion at configuration level, but SAP sync itself is `NOT_CONFIGURED` in all sessions, meaning dispatch completes without SAP writeback currently.

---

### 3.17 Loose records — `/barcode/loose/`

**Purpose:** Tracks partial-quantity "loose" carton sources that have been dismantled and are waiting to be repacked. When a box is opened and not all items are used, the remaining items are tracked here until they are consolidated into a new repack box.

**API endpoint:** `GET /barcode/loose/` (paginated)

**Key fields:**

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `item_code` / `item_name` | The SKU |
| `batch_number` | Batch |
| `qty` | Remaining loose quantity (often 0.00 after repacking) |
| `original_qty` | Original quantity when the loose record was created |
| `source_box` / `source_box_barcode` | The original box that was opened |
| `source_pallet` / `source_pallet_id` | Pallet the source box was on |
| `reason` | `OTHER`, `DAMAGED`, `MANUFACTURING_DEFECT`, etc. |
| `reason_notes` | Free-text notes |
| `status` | `PENDING` (not yet repacked) or `REPACKED` |
| `repacked_into_box` / `repacked_into_barcode` | FK to the new box created after repacking |

**Live data (7 records, all REPACKED):**
```
id=727: FG0000227 RICE BRAN OIL 1 LTR 16 PCS, batch L3 000051
  source: BOX-20260612-XX-4324 (8 PCS loose) → repacked into BOX-20260629-RP-0001
  reason: OTHER, warehouse: BH-PF
```

**Data presence:** 7 records total, all REPACKED (no pending loose items on 2026-06-30). Item is always RICE BRAN OIL 1 LTR 16 PCS, same batch.

---

### 3.18 Repack — `/barcode/repack/`

**Purpose:** Operator creates a new repack box by consolidating one or more loose records. Generates a new `BOX-YYYYMMDD-RP-NNNN` barcode. The repacked box gets a new label and enters inventory.

**API endpoint:** `POST /barcode/loose/` or similar write endpoint (not tested read-only).

---

### 3.19 Items / OITM — `/barcode/items/oitm/`

**Purpose:** SAP item master reference for finished-goods items that are barcode-managed. Used by the barcode system to validate item codes during box generation.

**API endpoint:** `GET /barcode/items/oitm/` (returns up to 100, list not paginated)

**Key fields:** `item_code`, `item_name`, `inventory_uom` (`PCS`), `manage_batch_numbers` (always `true`), `item_group_code` (always 102 = Finished Goods), `is_inventory_item`, `is_sales_item`, `valid_for`, `frozen_for`.

**Sample items:**
```
FG0000001: COLD PRESS 15 LTR
FG0000004: COLD PRESS 5 LTR 4 PCS
FG0000081: COLD PRESS SUNFLOWER 1 LTR 20 PCS
FG0000142: COLD PRESS GROUNDNUT OIL 1 LTR 16 PCS
FG0000227: RICE BRAN OIL 1 LTR 16 PCS
FG0000424: FIRST PRESSED MUSTARD OIL 1 LTR 20 PCS
```

**Data presence:** 100 items (list is capped at 100). All are item_group_code=102 (Finished Goods), all batch-managed, none are serial-managed.

---

### 3.20 Production release oil — `/barcode/production-release-oil/`

**Purpose:** Intended to release production-finished oil records from a SAP HANA table into the barcode system.

**Status for Jivo Mart:** NOT CONFIGURED. Live API returns:
```json
{"error": "(259, 'invalid table name: Could not find table/view PRODUCTION_RELEASE_OIL in schema JIVO_MART_HANADB')"}
```
The underlying HANA table `PRODUCTION_RELEASE_OIL` does not exist in the `JIVO_MART_HANADB` schema. This page is empty/broken for Jivo Mart.

---

### 3.21 Move, Split, Dismantle, Reprint, Traceability, Box-transfer

These are operational action pages (mostly POST-only write endpoints or lookup pages):

- **`/barcode/move`** — Move a box or pallet to a different warehouse/bin. Write operation.
- **`/barcode/split`** — Split one box into two or more boxes with smaller quantities. Write operation.
- **`/barcode/dismantle`** — Dismantle a box barcode (sets status to `DISMANTLED`, qty to 0). Used for damaged or empty cartons. 4 dismantled boxes exist in Jivo Mart.
- **`/barcode/reprint`** — Enter a barcode, select printer, send reprint. Uses `POST /barcode/print/history/`. Printer: TSC DA310.
- **`/barcode/traceability`** — Full traceability lookup: enter any barcode, get its complete history including intercompany trace. No distinct GET endpoint — builds from box/pallet detail + intercompany trace.
- **`/barcode/box-transfer` / `/barcode/transfer` / `/barcode/transfers/box/`** — Transfer boxes between internal warehouses. `/barcode/transfers/box/` is POST-only (GET returns "Method not allowed").
- **`/barcode/print/bulk/`** — Bulk print: select multiple barcodes, batch-print to the TSC printer.

---

## 4. Workflows (multi-step flows + statuses)

### 4.1 Box barcode generation and printing

```
Production run completes (line produces boxes)
  → Operator opens /barcode/boxes/generate/ (or /barcode/generate)
  → Selects item_code (from /barcode/items/oitm/), enters batch, mfg_date, exp_date, qty/box, box_count
  → System mints BOX-YYYYMMDD-XX-NNNN barcodes in sequence
  → Boxes created with status=ACTIVE, warehouse assigned
  → Labels printed to TSC DA310 via /barcode/print/bulk/ or auto-print
  → Print event logged in /barcode/print/history/ (print_type=INITIAL)
```

### 4.2 Palletizing

```
Boxes in warehouse → Operator creates pallet at /barcode/pallets/create/
  → System mints PLT-YYYYMMDD-XX-NNN
  → Operator scans boxes onto pallet (scan at /barcode/scan/)
  → Box.pallet FK updated; Box movement event: PALLETIZE added
  → Pallet box_count increments
  → Pallet status: ACTIVE (has boxes)
  → CLEARED = pallet was used but all boxes removed
```

### 4.3 Sales dispatch session

```
Dispatch team creates session from SAP invoice:
  POST /barcode/dispatch/bills/lookup/ with bill_number
    → Session created, status=DRAFT
    → SAP invoice lines imported (one line per material_code)

  Session goes DRAFT → PARTIAL as some boxes are scanned
    → Operator scans BOX or PLT barcodes at loading dock
    → Each scan: POST to session scan endpoint
    → Accepted scan: box status = DISPATCHED, movement event: DISPATCH
    → Rejected scan: logged to rejected-scans with rejection_code (BARCODE_NOT_FOUND, WRONG_ITEM, etc.)
    → Scan events logged in /barcode/scan/history/ (scan_type=SHIP, context=SALES_DISPATCH)

  PARTIAL → READY_TO_DISPATCH (all lines fulfilled)
    → can_dispatch = true
    → Operator reviews session summary at /barcode/dispatch/summary/{id}

  READY_TO_DISPATCH → COMPLETED (Dispatched by button)
    → dispatched_at and dispatched_by set
    → sap_sync_status would be triggered if configured (currently NOT_CONFIGURED)

  Alternatively: ACTIVE → CLOSED (manual close by operator with close_reason)
```

**Session status distribution (live):** DRAFT=19, PARTIAL=24, READY_TO_DISPATCH=11, ACTIVE=1, COMPLETED=2, CLOSED=0.

### 4.4 Intercompany transfer (JIVO_OIL → JIVO_MART)

```
Jivo Oil manufactures boxes → boxes exist in JIVO_OIL inventory
  → Transfer triggered at /barcode/intercompany/scan/ (JIVO_OIL operator scans boxes)
  → Each scan: POST to IC scan endpoint, validated in JIVO_OIL context
  → IC transfer record created: ICBT-{timestamp}
    → Lines added: one per barcode (item_code, batch, qty, from_company, to_company)
  → Transfer COMPLETED
    → Box ownership updated to JIVO_MART (current_company in trace = JIVO_MART)
    → Intercompany history: MANUFACTURED (JIVO_OIL) → SCANNED → TRANSFER_COMPLETED (JIVO_MART)
    → Visible in /barcode/intercompany/dashboard/ and /barcode/intercompany/transfers/

  Reverse transfer (JIVO_MART → JIVO_OIL): same process, 19 such transfers so far
```

### 4.5 Repack workflow

```
Damaged/partial box identified → Loose record created at /barcode/loose/
  → source_box, remaining_qty, reason recorded; status=PENDING

One or more loose records ready to consolidate:
  → Operator opens /barcode/repack/
  → Selects loose records (same item/batch)
  → System creates new BOX-YYYYMMDD-RP-NNNN barcode
  → New box status=ACTIVE, production_line=RP
  → Loose records: status → REPACKED, repacked_into_box set
  → New box: repacked_from[] lists all source loose records
  → New label printed via /barcode/reprint or /barcode/print/bulk/
```

### 4.6 Label reprint

```
Damaged or lost label → Operator goes to /barcode/reprint
  → Enters barcode or scans it
  → Selects printer (TSC DA310)
  → Submits reprint request
  → Print event logged: label_type=BOX, print_type=REPRINT, reprint_reason={code}, printed_by, printer_name
```

## 5. Cross-section connections

| This section | Connects to | How |
|---|---|---|
| **Box generate** | Production (section: Production) | Boxes are created after production runs complete; `production_run` FK in box record links to production run entity |
| **Dispatch sessions** | SAP AR Invoices | Sessions are created from SAP sales bills; `sap_doc_entry`, `sap_doc_num`, `delivery_number` link back to SAP Business One |
| **Dispatch sessions** | Warehouse | Box `current_warehouse` / `current_bin` tracks warehouse location; dispatch moves boxes out of BH-PF to customer |
| **Intercompany transfers** | Jivo Oil (JIVO_OIL company) | Boxes manufactured by Jivo Oil are transferred in; this is the primary stock replenishment route for Jivo Mart (994 transfers, 353,790 PCS received) |
| **Intercompany transfers** | Jivo Beverages (JIVO_BEVERAGES) | 4 transfers, 65 barcodes, 780 PCS received from Beverages |
| **Scan history** | All operations | Every scan from any context (dispatch, IC transfer) is logged here with context_ref_type and context_ref_id |
| **Print history** | Label printing hardware | All TSC DA310 label print events are centralised here |
| **Items/OITM** | SAP item master | Item master is the authoritative source for FG item codes and batch management settings |
| **Barcode boxes** | Gate / GRPO (Inbound) | Potentially: received goods could generate barcodes at gate (not confirmed for Jivo Mart — production-release-oil is the gap) |
| **Traceability** | Cross-section | Pulls from box movements, intercompany trace, and scan history to build a full audit trail |

**Summary for Jivo Mart:** The Barcode section is fully operational as the primary track-and-trace layer for finished goods. Box and pallet stock is high-volume and active. Dispatch sessions are heavily used (57 sessions, operators scanning on Android mobile). Intercompany transfers are the main stock intake route (994 transfers from Jivo Oil). The only non-functional piece is `production-release-oil`, which has a missing HANA table. SAP sync on dispatch completion is `NOT_CONFIGURED` — dispatches complete internally without writing back to SAP Business One.

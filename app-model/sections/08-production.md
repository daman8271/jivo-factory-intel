# Production — Jivo Mart app-model
> Last updated: 2026-06-30. Verified against live JIVO_MART API.

## 1. Purpose — what this section is for in the factory

The Production section is a **Manufacturing Execution System (MES)** module that covers the full lifecycle of factory floor production at Jivo Mart. It splits into two cooperating sub-modules:

- **Production Planning** (`/production/planning`): Manages SAP production orders — creation, editing, bulk import, and component-level shortfall tracking. A production plan is the bridge between a sales/demand signal and a shop-floor work order.
- **Production Execution** (`/production/execution`): Drives actual factory runs on named production lines. Operators start runs, log breakdowns and resource usage (electricity, water, gas), perform QC checks, record waste, and execute line-clearance procedures before changing SKUs. The system computes OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) per run and reports on cost-per-unit, downtime causes, and plan achievement.

Together the two sub-modules answer the core factory questions:
- What should be produced, when, and is raw material available? (Planning)
- What was produced, at what efficiency, with what waste and breakdowns? (Execution)

An additional read-only cross-system report — **Production Movement** — tracks SAP-level finished-goods inventory entries (GRPO receipts, transfers, AR invoices) regardless of whether MES run data exists. This is the only endpoint in this section that currently has live transactional data for Jivo Mart.

**Current status for Jivo Mart**: The module is architecturally complete but not yet operationally configured. No production lines, machines, runs, breakdowns, or waste entries have been created. All execution analytics return zero. The Production Movement report and the SAP plan-dashboard are populated.

## 4. Workflows (multi-step flows + statuses)

### 4.1 Production Planning Workflow

```
SAP creates Production Order
        ↓
Plan visible in /production/planning list
  [status: released]
        ↓
Component availability checked (sap/plan-dashboard/details)
  → If shortfall: components flagged, procurement action raised
  → If sufficient: plan ready to execute
        ↓
Operator creates Run in /production/execution/start-run
  (links run to plan via SAP order number)
        ↓
[status: completed — when planned_qty = completed_qty]
```

**SAP production order statuses observed**: `released`, `completed`, `closed`

### 4.2 Production Run Lifecycle (MES execution — not yet active for Jivo Mart)

```
start-run page
  → Select line + SAP order + FG item + planned qty
        ↓
Run created [status: PENDING / PLANNED]
        ↓
Operator starts run [status: IN_PROGRESS]
  ├── Log breakdowns → [BREAKDOWN → RESUMED]
  ├── Log resources (electricity, water, gas, air, labour)
  ├── Log QC checks (linked to quality-control/production-qc)
  └── Log waste entries (pending QA approval)
        ↓
Run completed [status: COMPLETED]
  → Yield recorded (actual output vs planned)
        ↓
OEE calculated: availability × performance × quality
Cost allocated: resources → cost/unit
```

### 4.3 Line Clearance Workflow (MES — not yet active)

```
Line finishes a batch (run completed)
        ↓
Line clearance created [status: PENDING]
  → Operator works through checklist template items
  → Each item marked PASS / FAIL with notes
        ↓
All items checked [status: IN_PROGRESS → AWAITING_APPROVAL]
        ↓
Supervisor reviews
  → Approved: [status: APPROVED] → Line cleared for next product
  → Rejected: [status: REJECTED] → Must re-do clearance
        ↓
Next run can start on that line
```

### 4.4 Waste Approval Workflow (MES — not yet active)

```
Operator logs waste during run
  → Waste entry created [approval_status: PENDING]
        ↓
QA reviewer assesses (approves or rejects recorded quantity)
  → [approval_status: APPROVED / REJECTED]
        ↓
Approved waste included in waste-trend analytics
```

## 5. Cross-section connections

| This section | Links to | How |
|---|---|---|
| Production Planning | SAP / Procurement | SAP production order (prod_order_num) links to raw material POs; component shortfall flags trigger procurement action |
| Production Planning | Warehouse (WMS) | component_warehouse + warehouse field on order; component stock_on_hand read from SAP warehouse master |
| Production Run | QC (quality-control) | Runs link to `quality-control/production-qc` for in-process quality checks during execution |
| Production Run | Barcode/Traceability | Finished goods boxes printed during or after a run (BarcodeBox.production_line field references the line name) |
| Production Run → Yield | Warehouse / FG Receipts | When a run completes, the FG quantity is receipted into warehouse (`/warehouse/fg-receipts/`) and a GRPO document is posted in SAP |
| Production Movement report | Warehouse (WMS) | Reads the same SAP FG movement postings that the WMS tracks; three shared warehouses (BH-FGM, DL-MP, BH-FK) |
| Production Movement report | Dispatch | AR Invoice and Delivery outward movements represent goods dispatched to customers (same SAP doc_num seen in dispatch section) |
| Breakdown Categories | Maintenance | Machine breakdowns recorded here overlap with the Maintenance module's work-order system (machine_id is shared) |
| Line Clearance | QC | Line clearance can trigger a QC inspection of the cleaned line before the next batch starts |

## 6. Data presence for Jivo Mart (which pages have live data vs empty)

### Has live data

| Endpoint | Count / Notes |
|---|---|
| `/sap/plan-dashboard/summary/` | 1 production order (FG0000326 SANO POMACE 1+1 LTR, 160 units, completed, DL-MP) |
| `/sap/plan-dashboard/details/` | Same 1 order with full component tree (1 component: FG0000150, fully issued) |
| `/sap/plan-dashboard/procurement/` | 0 shortage items (the single order has no shortfall) |
| `/production-execution/reports/production-movement/` | 500 entries for 2026-01-01→2026-06-30 (limited by 500-row cap); ₹98.47M total value across 3 warehouses |
| `/production-execution/reports/production-movement/filter-options/` | 3 warehouses, 12 transaction types |
| `/production-execution/reports/analytics/monthly-summary/` | Returns structured object (12 months) but all zeros — schema confirmed |
| All other `/production-execution/reports/analytics/*` | Return valid JSON schema objects but all zeros/empty arrays — confirmed endpoints exist |

### Empty for Jivo Mart (not yet configured)

| Endpoint | Count | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `/production-execution/lines/` | 0 | No production lines registered |
| `/production-execution/machines/` | 0 | No machines registered |
| `/production-execution/line-configs/` | 0 | No line configuration done |
| `/production-execution/runs/` | 0 | No production runs ever started |
| `/production-execution/breakdown-categories/` | 0 | No breakdown categories defined |
| `/production-execution/checklist-templates/` | 0 | No checklist templates created |
| `/production-execution/machine-checklists/` | 0 | No machine checklist executions |
| `/production-execution/line-clearance/` | 0 | No line clearance records |
| `/production-execution/waste/` | 0 | No waste entries |
| `/production-execution/sap/orders/` | 0 (live) | SAP orders not being pulled/linked into MES |
| `/production-execution/sap/items/` | 0 (live) | Item master not configured in MES; 193-item catalog exists in cached state |
| `/production-execution/costs/analytics/` | 0 | No cost records (no runs) |
| `/production-execution/reports/line-clearance/` | 0 | No clearance records |
| `/quality-control/production-qc/` | 0 | No in-process QC entries |

### Note on sap/items discrepancy
The raw captured file `/root/jivo-factory-intel/raw/production-execution__sap__items.json` contains 193 FG/RM items (captured from local cache in a prior sync). The live API returns `[]`. This suggests the item master was configured at some point during setup/testing but has since been cleared or the live endpoint has stricter filters. The 193 items catalog (FG, RM, SL, SC prefixes) represents the full production SKU universe for Jivo Mart.
